# tumor-detection
Tumor Detection Project  This project uses machine learning to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using the sklearn breast cancer dataset. A Random Forest Classifier was trained and achieved high accuracy (~97–98%). Feature importance analysis highlighted key tumor characteristics, demonstrating that ML can support early tumor detection.
